    <ul>
        <!-- Q1 -->
        <li>Create a function called simulateAsyncOperation that simulates an
            asynchronous operation. The function should take a boolean
            parameter shouldSucceed, and it should return a Promise that either
            resolves with a success message or rejects with an error message
            based on the value of shouldSucceed. Use this function to simulate
            both successful and failed asynchronous operations.</li>


        <br><br><br>
        <!-- Q2 -->
        <li>Create two functions, fetchData and processData, each returning a
            Promise. fetchData should simulate fetching data, and processData
            should simulate processing the fetched data. Chain these promises
            together to fetch and process data in sequence. Log the final result to the console.</li>
